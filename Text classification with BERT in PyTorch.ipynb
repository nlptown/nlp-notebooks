    "2018 was an exciting year for Natural Language Processing. One of the most promising evolutions was the breakthrough of transfer learning. Models like Elmo Embeddings, ULMFit and BERT allow us to pre-train a neural network on a large collection of unlabelled texts. Thanks to an auxiliary task such as language modelling, these models are able to learn a lot about the syntax, semantics and morphology of a language. This knowledge can be put to good use: because they already know so much about language use, these models need much less labelled data to reach state-of-the-art performance on other tasks, such as text classification, sequence labelling or question answering. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular models is [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), developed by researchers at Google. BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. It uses the Transformer architecture to pretrain bidirectional \"language models\". By adding just one task-specific output layer, it is possible to use such a pre-trained BERT model on a variety of NLP tasks. In this notebook, we're going to investigate its performance on a sentiment analysis task, where the task is to predict whether a review is positive or negative. Unfortunately, we can't share the data, but you can easily plug in your own."

    "- a list of input ids. Take a look at the logging output to see what this means. Every text has been split up into subword units, which are shared between all the languages in the multilingual model. When a word appears frequently enough in a combined corpus of all languages, it is kept intact. If it is less frequent, it is split up into subword units that do occur frequently enough across all languages. This allows our model to process every text as a sequence of strings from a finite vocabulary of limited size. Note also the first `[CLS]` token. This token is added at the beginning of every document. The vector at the output of this token will be used by the BERT model for its sequence classification tasks: it serves as the input of the final, task-specific part of the neural network.\n",
    "- the input mask: the input mask tells the model which parts of the input it should look at and which parts it should ignore. In our example, we have made sure that every text has a length of 100 tokens. This means that some texts will be cut off after 100 tokens, while others will have to be padded with extra tokens. In this latter case, these padding tokens will receive a mask value of 0, which means BERT should not take them into account for its classification task. \n",
    "- the segment_ids: some NLP task take several sequences as input. This is the case for question answering, natural language inference, etc. In this case, the segment ids tell BERT which sequence every token belongs to. In a text classification task like ours, however, there's only one segment, so all the input tokens receive segment id 0.\n",
