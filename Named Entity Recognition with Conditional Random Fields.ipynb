    "One of the classic challenges of Natural Language Processing is sequence labelling. In sequence labelling, the goal is to label each word in a text with a word class. In part-of-speech tagging, these word classes are parts of speech, such as noun or verb. In named entity recognition (NER), they're types of generic named entities, such as locations, people or organizations, or more specialized entities, such as diseases or symptoms in the healthcare domain. In this way, sequence labelling can help us extract the most important information from a text and improve the performance of analytics, search or matching applications. "

You can install it with `pip install sklearn-crfsuite`."

A well-known data set for training and testing NER models is the CoNLL-2002 data, which has Spanish and Dutch texts labelled with four types of entities: locations (LOC), persons (PER), organizations (ORG) and miscellaneous entities (MISC). Both corpora are split up in three portions: a training portion and two smaller test portions, one of which we'll use as development data. It's easy to collect the data from NLTK. "

    "Whereas today neural networks are expected to learn the relevant features of the input texts themselves, this is very different with Conditional Random Fields. CRFs learn the relationship between the features we give them and the label of a token in a given context. They're not going to earn these features themselves. Instead, the quality of the model will depend highly on the relevance of the features we show it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important method in this tutorial is therefore the one that collects the features for every token. What information could be useful? The word itself, of course, together with its part of speech tag. It can also be interesting to know whether the word is completely uppercase, whether it starts with a capital or is a digit. In addition, we also take a look at the character bigram and trigram the word ends with. We also give every token a `bias` feature, which always has the same value. This bias feature helps the CRF learn the relative frequency of each label type in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give the CRF more information about the meaning of a word, we also introduce information from word embeddings. In our [Word Embedding notebook](https://github.com/nlptown/nlp-notebooks/blob/master/An%20Introduction%20to%20Word%20Embeddings.ipynb), we trained word embeddings on Dutch Wikipedia and clustered them in 500 clusters. Here we'll read these 500 clusters from a file, and map each word to the id of the cluster it is in. This is really useful for Named Entity Recognition, as most entity types cluster together. This allows CRFs to generalize above the word level. For example, when the CRF encounters a word it has never seen (say, *Albania*), it can base its decision on the cluster the word is in. If this cluster contains many other entities the CRF has met in its training data (say, *Italy*, *Germany* and *France*), it will have learnt a string link between this cluster and a specific entity type. As a result, it can still assign that entity type to the unknown word. In our experiments, this feature alone boosts the performance with around 3%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, apart from the token itself, we also want the CRF to look at its context. More specifically, we're going to give it some extra information about the two words to the left and the right of the targt word. We'll tell the CRF what these words are, whether they start with a capital or are completely uppercase, and give it their part-of-speech tag. If there is no left or right context, we'll inform the CRF that the token is at the beginning or end of the sentence (`BOS` or `EOS`). "

    "So far we've trained a model with the default parameters. It's unlikely that these will give us the best performance possible. Therefore we're going to search automatically for the best hyperparameter settings by iteratively training different models and evaluating them. Eventually we'll pick the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll focus on two parameters: `c1` and `c2`. These are the parameters for L1 and L2 regularization, respectively. Regularization prevents overfitting on the training data by adding a penalty to the loss function. In L1 regularization, this penalty is the sum of the absolute values of the weights; in L2 regularization, it is the sum of the squared weights. L1 regularization performs a type of feature selection, as it assigns 0 weight to irrelevant features. L2 regularization, by contrast, makes the weight of irrelevant features small, but not necessarily zero. L1 regularization is often called the Lasso method, L2 is called the Ridge method, and the linear combination of both is called Elastic Net regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the parameter space for c1 and c2 and use the flat F1-score to compare the individual models. We'll rely on three-fold cross validation to score each of the 50 candidates. We use a randomized search, which means we're not going to try out all specified parameter settings, but instead, we'll let the process sample randomly from the distributions we've specified in the parameter space. It will do this 50 (`n_iter`) times. This process takes a while, but it's worth the wait."
